     <h1><u>The story of why company was founded</u></h1>
     <p>
     	The story of starting a home grown food restaurant was to make Basotho people to appreciate culture more and to embrace foods that the country has to offer. And so to have foreigner to know and taste our food, love and see what our country has to offer.
     </p>
     <h1><u>My journey</u></h1>
     <p>
     	Firstly I started to see people being interest in other people s culture, food and lifestyle. The plan was to give the generation to come their heritage and let them know  about their culture and food prepared. I grew up eating food prepare by my grandmother who passed it on to my mom and I always loved Lesotho food and want my kids that I will have in future know the types of food I ate growing up.
     </p>
     <h2><u>There many foods that we still offer rather than one we have displayed, the list is as follows</u>:</h2>
     <ul>
     	<li><i>likhetso</li>
     	<li>nyekoe</li>
     	<li>likhobe</li>
     	<li>poone</li>
     	<li>lihoapa</li>
     	<li>liphaphatha</i></li>
     </ul>
     <h3><u>The vision</u></h3>
     <p>
     	My main mission is to have people eat other home food and witness the amazing things that build our culture and give purpose to our day to day meals that have made and build us. My biggest dreams it to open a big companies in the whole of Lesotho and rest of the world.
